matrixIxirtam
matrixi checks for synchronisation of several cameras using both OpenHardWare and OpenSoftWare components.
* matrix component shows a matrix (i.e. 2D array) representing a counter number.
* xirtam component reads the number from the recorded images using basic image processing.
Note: matrix or xirtam component will be derived in several materials (using either differents hardware or library, e.g. CImg.matrix is the matrix component based on CImg library)

components
* matrix (write matrix)
** CImg.matrix is the CImg library based matrix component
* xirtam (read  matrix)
** CImg.xirtam is the CImg library based xirtam component

external library
* CImg: The CImg Library - C++ Template Image Processing Toolkit (http://cimg.sourceforge.net)
