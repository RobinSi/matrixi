matrixIxirtam
matrixi checks for synchronisation of several cameras using both OpenHardWare and OpenSoftWare components.
it is based on displaying a number as a 16 bit matrix (i.e. 4x4 matrix).

* matrix component shows a matrix (i.e. 2D array) representing a counter number.
* xirtam component reads the number from the recorded images using basic image processing.
Note: matrix or xirtam component will be derived in several materials (using either differents hardware or library, e.g. CImg.matrix is the matrix component based on CImg library)

components
* matrix (write matrix)
** CImg.matrix is the CImg library based matrix component (i.e. an OpenSoftWare):
   it display, on a computer screen, a matrix that is representing a number.
   after a delay set by the user, it increments the number and shows it.
   several cameras may record the images in time.
** AVR.matrix is the AVR libC library based matrix component (i.e. an OpenHardWare):
   it display, on an array of LED, a matrix that is representing a number.
   after a delay set by the programmer, it increments the number and shows it.
   several cameras may record the images in time.
   note: actually use Arduino Mega1280 with LED mapping

* xirtam (read  matrix)
** CImg.xirtam is the CImg library based xirtam component (i.e. an OpenSoftWare):
   it process different images to get the number from the matrix.
   it handles a set of cameras.
   the calibration procedure asks for the selection of both position and level of the matrix.
   these are selected by the user throug the GUI for each camera.
   then simple image processing is made to get numbers.
   results are displayed on GUI; at the end, a boolean tell if all camera are synchronised or not.
   note: calibration parameters are saved, so hudge batch can be run without any user request.
